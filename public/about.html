                    <h3>Vue</h3>
                    <p>This is a popular JS framework used to make reactive web applications. We used it for binding all interactive page elements to ref variables.</p>

                    <h3>Leaflet API</h3>

                    <h3>Nominatim API</h3>
                    <p>This API is used for converting addresses to coordinates and back again. We used it to make the address bar above the map accurately reflect position, and to correctly move to new locations.</p>

                <div class="tool-desc">
                    <h3>Express</h3>
                    <p>This is a Node.js web server framework. We used it primarily to implement the REST API needed for the crime statistics.</p>

                    <h3>SQLite3</h3>

                    <h3>cors</h3>
                    <p>This is a simple Node.js library used in conjunction with Express. We used it so that we could make requests from the website at localhost:5173, to the REST server at localhost:8000</p>
